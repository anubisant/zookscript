As a very young software developer, i remeber playing Zork on a Apple III. Was hot stuff on a green screen.

Today I want to explore JavaScript and a similar experience in the Chrome console. This is my simple tool for learning some javascript.

Finish movement - Add swim() motion

Add View() - create a prototype for look and search

Health - thinking thirsty, hungry, and tired

Interact with objects - take, throw, drop, read

Add speech - say, yell, tell, etc.

Maintain Inventory

add NPC's - interact with other people and beasts

Create a MeteorJS application
